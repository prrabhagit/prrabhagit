# Hi, I’m Prabha Sapkota

I’m a second-year engineering student from Nepal who genuinely enjoys building, learning, and understanding technology at a deeper level. I’m especially interested in how **software, systems, and AI** come together—and I’m committed to learning them properly, from the ground up.

I like progress that’s steady, intentional, and meaningful.

## About Me

- Second-year engineering student  
- Focused on **full-stack development** and **AI/ML**  
- Learning **DSA step by step**, with emphasis on clarity and problem-solving  
- Comfortable working in **Linux** and interested in system-level concepts  
- Exploring **electronics** to better understand hardware–software interaction  
- Enjoy **creative coding** that blends math, logic, and visuals  
- Value discipline, consistency, and long-term growth  

I care about understanding *why* & *how* things work—not just making them work.

## One thing about me
  Beyond the technical side, I’m deeply driven by curiosity, independence, and ambition. I enjoy learning things thoroughly, questioning assumptions, and building confidence through real competence.

 I’m intentional about owning my space, trusting my abilities, and growing without needing to be loud about it. I value patience, resilience, and showing up consistently — especially when progress is quiet.


## So, If you enjoy learning with intention and watching real growth unfold, you’re welcome to explore my work here. Do leave a star to the project you found interesting or liked it. ##
